Project Title
Issue Detection System for Railway Facilities

Description
This project involves a system that analyzes photos to detect and classify issues related to electricity, water, and security in railway facilities. The system processes the input image to identify whether it depicts an electricity issue, water issue, or a security concern.

Features
Image Upload: Allows users to upload photos for analysis.
Issue Detection: Automatically classifies the image into one of the following categories:
Electricity Issue: Identifies problems related to electrical components.
Water Issue: Detects water-related issues, such as leaks or floods.
Security Issue: Flags potential security problems or breaches.
Feedback: Provides specific feedback based on the detected issue.
Technologies Used
Python: For backend processing and image classification.
TensorFlow: For machine learning model implementation.
Firebase: For photo storage and management.
OpenCV/PIL: For image processing.
